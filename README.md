## EliteTale-Hotel
EliteTale Hotel is a Swedish hotel with state-of-the art guestrooms combine modern style and undeniable
comfort, with original artwork complementing the Swedish furnishings. The
muted colour schemes contrast with the city lights and skyscrapers in the
background. All of our rooms include LCD flat-screen televisions, wired or
wireless internet access, individual air conditioning control, an in-room
safe, complimentary tea and coffee making facilities, and luxurious
bathrobes and slippers.

The online hotel reservation channels have
dramatically changed booking possibilities and
customers’ behavior. A significant number of
hotel reservations are called-off due to
cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons
for cancellations include change of plans,
scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made
easier by the option to do so free of charge or
preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to
hotel guests but it is a less desirable and
possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels
to deal with.
